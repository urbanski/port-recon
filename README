port-recon is a tool that reads any argus-compatible flow data and identifies IP address and port combinations that may be publicly accessible. If they are publicly accessible (read: accessible from the system running port-recon) then it attempts to fingerprint the service and service version information for the service running on that port. port-recon is useful because IPv6 networks are not easily (or feasibly) scanned and port-recon can identify and scan active IPv6 hosts by validating their flows.

requirements
=============
python-pyscopg2

usage
======

Most basic usage:

./port-recon -f my_file

This prints all host:port combinations with a 128 packet threshold with the output format
addr:port:open|closed|filtered|unknown:service fingerprint

--networks
Specifies a networks file. The networks file contains a list of valid local network addresses.
